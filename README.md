# What the flux?

## Objectives

1. Describe the main components of a flux-y application
2. Explain how data travels through a flux-based application
3. Explain why stores in Flux don't have public setters

## Overview

Introduce students to the basics of Flux. We can lean on the "official" Facebook
implementation (even though it's a little wonky at times), since that's what
students will use for their first pass at building a flux-based ap p in this
unit.

The main thing that students will need is a walkthrough of how components lead
to actions lead to stores lead to components. The dispatcher is essential (and
confusing, it turns out), so feel free to dwell on that a bit.
